umlbox is a UML-based (UserMode Linux-based) solution for sandboxing
applications.

You can use any UML kernel which supports the initrd.gz and hostfs filesystems
to run UMLBox. On Debian, the user-mode-linux package includes such a kernel.
Alternatively, you may extract Linux 3.4.4 to umlbox/linux-3.4.4 (substitute
for another version in Makefile if you prefer), and a suitable kernel will be
built for you. Other versions of Linux should work as well, add the flag
LINUX=<dir> to your `make` line to use another version.

Use `make` or `make all` to build umlbox and an included kernel. Use
`make nokernel` to build only the non-kernel components, to use another UML
kernel.  In either case, `make install` installs umlbox (ignore error output if
you're not installing the kernel), and you may use
`make install PREFIX=<some prefix>` to install to a custom prefix.
